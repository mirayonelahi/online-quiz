## Follow the instructions to launch the application

** if all of the instructions followed before then just migrate the database by refreshing. ("php artisan migrate:refresh")

1. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Go to client directory.
4. Open terminal.
5. "npm install" run this command to install npm.
6. Then go to server directory.
7. Open terminal and run these following command:
	-> "cp .env.example .env"
	-> "composer install"
	-> "php artisan key:generate"
8. Open the .env file in your server directory and edit the database name to "your_database_name", username to "root" and password to "".
9. Now create a database by the name "your_database_name".
10. "php artisan migrate" run this command in the server directory.
11. Run "php artisan serve" on server directory and "npm start" in the client directory.

** if composer isn't installed on your composer then install it from https://getcomposer.org/


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
